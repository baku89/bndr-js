Bndr.js /ˈbaɪndɚ/ is a library designed to compose events from various user inputs and chain filters in a monadic manner, and thereby integrating them into a single event object. It accommodates input devices such as mice, styluses, touch inputs, keyboards, [MIDI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_MIDI_API) controllers, and [gamepads](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API).

- Associating user inputs with arbitrary triggers for VJing
- Introducing manual operations in generative art.
